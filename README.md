This repository contains an implementation of the zero-knowledge protocol due
to the 2013 paper _Zero Knowledge with Rubik’s Cubes and Non-abelian Groups_
by Volte, Patarin, and Nachef (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-02937-5_5).

Additionally, new parameter sets have been added that are more efficient and/or
more secure than the originally proposed parameter sets. These parameter sets
are S41*, S43*, and S53*.

This project accompanies the Master's thesis _Cryptographic Schemes based on
Rubik's Cubes_ that was submitted to the Leibniz Universität Hannover in 2021.
